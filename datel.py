    Goal: represent an XML element as a python data structure suitable for converting to JSON.

    The XML element is converted to a dict with a single key.

    The key is the XML element's tag name with namespaces in James Clark notation.

    The value of the key is an array of two array elements.

    The first array element is the text of the XML element.

    The second array element is a dict of the attributes of the XML element.
