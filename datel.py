    Datel Data Element

    Goal: represent an XML element as a python data structure suitable for converting to JSON.

    The XML element is converted to a dict with a single key.

    The key is the XML element's tag name with namespaces in James Clark notation.

    The value of the key is a dict of the XML element's attributes, with one of two
    additional keys.

     - `text()` contains the text of an element with no children
     - `mix()` contains an xml fragment of an element with children

    ```
    <tag attribute="value">string of <inner>content</inner></tag>
    {'tag': {'attribute': 'value', 'mix()': 'string of <inner>content</inner>'}}
