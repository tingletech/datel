    Datel Data Element

    Goal: represent an XML element as a python data structure suitable for converting to JSON.

    The XML element is converted to a dict with a single key.

    The key is the XML element's tag name with namespaces in James Clark notation.

    The value of the key is an array of two array elements.

    - The first array element is a string containing the inner markup of XML element.

    - The second array element is a dict of the attributes of the XML element.

    The whole thing is a datel data element.
